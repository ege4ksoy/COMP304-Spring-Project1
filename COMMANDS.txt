Can you explain the error please, I  cannot compile:
[eaksoy22@linux06 Comp304]$ gcc -o shell-ish shellish-skeleton.c
shellish-skeleton.c: In function ‘free_command’:
shellish-skeleton.c:62:5: error: ‘for’ loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode 
     for (int i = 0; i < command->arg_count; ++i)
     ^
shellish-skeleton.c:62:5: note: use option -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 to compile your code        
shellish-skeleton.c:66:3: error: ‘for’ loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode 
   for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i)
   ^
shellish-skeleton.c: In function ‘parse_command’:
shellish-skeleton.c:206:3: error: ‘for’ loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode
   for (int i = command->arg_count - 2; i > 0; --i)

when I enter this in terminal : eaksoy22@linux06:/Users/eaksoy22/Comp304 shellish$ cat output.txt | cut -d ":" -f1,6  it is not printing anything?

bana tavsiye verebilir misin, Kendimize ait custom command yazmamız isteniyor:

Custom Command (Can be written in any language): The last command is any new

Shell-ish command of your choice. Come up with a new command that is not too trivial and

implement it inside of Shell-ish. Be creative. Selected commands will be shared with your

peers in the class. Note that many commands you come up with may have been already

implemented in Unix. That should not stop you from implementing your own. Create a

README.md explaining your command and some sample usage.
